Flow is maybe the most overused word in the Data Engineering world.  There is a running joke in the industry that every
company, at some point in their histry, has to develop an internal tool named DataFlow.  Google, now have finally
put a nail in that for new projects with it Google Cloud Offering, has only given rise the slight variations on the name
for new workflow and data systems.  It is a suffix that will not disappear.


On the site I hope to post general things I find interesting or possibly useful for other folks particurally in the intesection
of Data and Machine Learning.  Most posts will be on my specific patterns I have found useful whiile trying to build systems but
I hope to spend some time thinking about higher level concepts as well.

```python
import flow

flow.init()
```
